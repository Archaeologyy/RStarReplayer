# Written Instructions:

Run as administrator

Click "No Saving: ON" when you are near completion of a heist (for example, exiting the compound on Cayo Perico)

Complete the heist as normal

When you are able to freely move in GTA Online, exit to Story Mode

Wait until Story Mode is finished loading, wait 10 seconds while in Story Mode, then click "No Saving: OFF"

You should have the money from the heist, but said heist is still able to be played.

Repeat these steps until you've made enough money!

## FAQ:

**What does this program do?**

This program creates a firewall rule that blocks outbound traffic to Rockstar's GTA Online stats server IP. This allows a knowledgeable player to pick and choose what is saved on their GTAO character (like heist completion.) This is much more sophisticated and reliable than the old nosave methods (unplugging ethernet, turning off WiFi, disabling network adapters.)

**Why is Smartscreen/my antivirus detecting this program?**

This is a *false positive detection*, likely recognizing that this is an unsigned, uncommonly ran program. If you are suspicious of malware, you can download the source code to see for yourself.

**What does the manual rule check button do?**

This opens a command prompt that searches for the rule and then displays whether or not it was found. Think of it like a double check, use if you aren't sure if the rule is created or not.
